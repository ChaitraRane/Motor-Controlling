# Hand Gesture Controlled Motor System

## Overview
This project allows users to control two motors using hand gestures detected by a webcam. The gestures are interpreted using OpenCV and CVZone, and the corresponding motor movements are executed through an Arduino connected via PyFirmata.

## Features
- Uses a webcam to detect hand gestures.
- Controls two motors via an Arduino and an L298N motor driver.
- Different gestures trigger specific motor actions (e.g., move forward, turn left/right, stop).

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board
- L298N Motor Driver
- 2 DC Motors
- Webcam
- Computer with Python installed

## Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- CVZone (`cvzone`)
- PyFirmata (`pyfirmata`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hand-Gesture-Motor-Control.git
   cd Hand-Gesture-Motor-Control
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python cvzone pyfirmata
   ```
3. Connect the Arduino and modify `controller.py` to match the correct COM port.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
2. Use the following hand gestures to control the motors:
   - No fingers up: Stop both motors
   - Index finger up: Turn right
   - Index and middle finger up: Turn left
   - Three fingers up: Move forward
   - Four fingers up: Move backward
   - All fingers up: Move at full speed
3. Press 'k' to exit.

## Files
- `main.py`: Handles hand detection and gesture recognition.
- `controller.py`: Controls the motor based on recognized gestures.
